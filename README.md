## Ask your agent for a video

fframes ships a skill for coding agents. Add it once:

```sh
npx skills add https://fframes.studio
```

Then describe the video you want, the way you would brief a motion designer. The skill takes your agent from an empty
folder to a rendered `.mp4`: it installs fframes, creates a project, designs the motion, places the sound, and checks
the result before handing it to you.

The fframes API is explicit and verbose, and that is [why it stayed unreleased for years](https://x.com/neogoose_btw/status/2104432563146444994).
Writing explicit, verbose code is exactly what an agent with the right skill is good at.

## Built for an author that cannot watch

A coding agent cannot watch a video or hear a soundtrack. Every generated project comes with a command line that turns
a video into things an agent can read: PNGs, text and numbers.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="50%">Your agent</th>
    <th width="50%">You</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      <b>Checks every frame without rendering pixels.</b><br />
      <code>inspect</code> reports missing fonts or images, text cut off by the canvas, invalid SVG and panics, each with its time and scene.<br /><br />
      <b>Looks at the motion.</b><br />
      <code>strip</code> lays evenly spaced frames out on one contact sheet, <code>onion</code> blends frames to show a movement's path and easing, <code>frame</code> writes full-size PNGs.<br /><br />
      <b>Measures the sound.</b><br />
      <code>audio analyze</code> reports loudness (LUFS), true peak, clipping and silence, per scene.
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      <b>Watch it in real time, with sound.</b><br />
      <code>preview</code> opens a GPU window to play, pause, seek and step through frame by frame.<br /><br />
      <b>Scrub it in the browser.</b><br />
      The editor runs the video compiled to WebAssembly, with a timeline.<br /><br />
      <b>Ship it.</b><br />
      <code>render</code> writes the final file; <code>render --draft</code> encodes one scene at half size in about a second.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Every command runs as `cargo run --release -- <command>` inside the project:

| command | output |
| --- | --- |
| `timeline` | the scenes with their frame and second ranges, and every audio track with its mix settings |
| `inspect` | problems in a frame every 0.25 s and the first and last frame of every scene; exit code 2 on errors |
| `strip <scene> -n 12` | `strip.png`, a labelled contact sheet |
| `frame <scene>@end,<scene>@50%` | full-size PNGs in `frames/` |
| `onion "<scene>@0..<scene>@1s" -n 6` | `onion.png`, the blended movement |
| `audio analyze --waveform w.png` | the loudness report and a waveform with scene lines and cue ticks |
| `snapshot` | a comparison with approved PNGs, `.diff.png` marks what changed |
| `preview` | the real-time window, for a human |
| `render [--draft]` | the video, or a part of it |

`<scene>` is the name of a scene struct in your video. Times read as `120` (frame), `3.2s`, `50%`, `<scene>@1.2s`, and
ranges like `<scene>@0..<scene>@1s`. Add `--json` to parse the output.

## Why it is fast

- **The GPU draws.** The Skia backend renders on Metal (macOS) or Vulkan (Linux, Windows), about 10x faster than the built-in CPU backend.
- **Static markup is cached.** Parts of a frame without `{expressions}` are hashed at compile time and reused by the renderers.
- **ffmpeg encodes.** fframes links ffmpeg's libav libraries instead of shelling out to a separate tool.
- **Shaders when SVG is not enough.** Run SkSL or pasted Shadertoy GLSL as a layer of any frame.

## What your agent writes

Every frame is an SVG tree returned by a Rust function, written with the `svgr!` macro. From
[examples/hello-world](examples/hello-world/src/hello_world.rs), shortened: a square moves along a timeline and a line
of text prints the current frame.

## Without an agent

```sh
cargo install --locked cargo-fframes
cargo fframes new my-video
cd my-video && cargo run --release -- preview
```

`cargo fframes new` takes `--template single-scene|multi-scene`, `--format landscape|portrait|square|uhd`, `--fps`,
`--title` and `--backend`. On macOS and Linux (arm64, x86_64) the first build downloads prebuilt Skia and ffmpeg
libraries and takes under a minute on a fast machine; other targets and feature combinations
compile them from source (up to ~20 minutes). Later builds take seconds. `--backend cpu` skips Skia (no preview window, slower renders). To track `main`, install with
`--git https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/fframes`.

## Requirements

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and, for working on the editor, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
fframes links ffmpeg's libav libraries statically. A prebuilt build is downloaded for macOS and Linux (arm64 and x86_64) and
compiled from source for other targets or `FFMPEG_FORCE_BUILD=1`; either way the system encoders they link against have to be installed.

The examples enable `fframes/build-portable` on native non-Windows targets. CI builds the
whole workspace, combining the examples' x264, x265, VPX and Opus features; no published
FFmpeg archive currently matches that combination, so it falls back to a source build.
Without `build-portable`, that build uses `-march=native -mtune=native`. Caching it and
restoring it on a runner with a different CPU can cause `SIGILL` (illegal instruction).
The feature omits those flags for source builds while keeping matching prebuilt downloads
enabled, and also applies to FFmpeg used by the compile-time media macro.

Within this workspace, use the same setting for native builds that will be cached or run on
other machines:

```toml
[target.'cfg(not(any(target_arch = "wasm32", windows)))'.dependencies]
fframes = { workspace = true, features = ["build-portable"] }
```

`build-portable` also enables FFmpeg's source-build support, so the examples exclude Windows
(which links a shared FFmpeg installation) and browser targets. Setting `FFMPEG_MARCH` or
`FFMPEG_MTUNE`, even to an empty string, bypasses prebuilt downloads; prefer the feature when
you want portable source fallbacks and prebuilt downloads.

```

for nix users:
```sh
nix-shell
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windows</b></summary>

On Windows ffmpeg is not compiled from source. Instead fframes links a prebuilt **FFmpeg 9.0** shared build
(for example `ffmpeg-n9.0-latest-win64-gpl-shared-9.0.zip` from [BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/tag/latest))
and needs LLVM for bindgen:

```powershell
winget install LLVM.LLVM
# unzip the ffmpeg build somewhere, then point the build to it:
$env:FFMPEG_DIR = "C:\ffmpeg-n9.0-latest-win64-gpl-shared-9.0"
$env:LIBCLANG_PATH = "C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin"
# the ffmpeg DLLs must be reachable when building (proc macros load them) and running
$env:PATH = "$env:FFMPEG_DIR\bin;$env:PATH"
```

`vcpkg install ffmpeg` works as well instead of `FFMPEG_DIR`. Codecs come from the prebuilt build, so leave the
codec features (`h264`, `h265`, ...) off: they request a from-source ffmpeg build which is not supported on Windows.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codecs</b></summary>

Cargo features of the `fframes` crate choose which codecs and hardware acceleration libraries are linked:

```toml
[dependencies]
# this will enable and try to link libx264 during the build
fframes = { version = "1", features = ["h264", "libav-agree-gpl"] }
```

All the build and linking of codecs and other system libs are leveraging the ffmpeg build system, so for
troubleshooting please refer the [ffmpeg compilation guide](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Troubleshooting</b></summary>

- **Build fails in `ffmpeg-sys-fframes`:** a system library from the list above is missing (`nasm`, `pkg-config`, the codec packages).
- **Build fails in the Skia bindings with a bindgen or libclang error** (only when Skia is compiled from source, e.g. with
  both `metal` and `vulkan` enabled): point `LIBCLANG_PATH` at a working libclang,
  on macOS Xcode's: `export LIBCLANG_PATH=$(xcode-select -p)/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib`.
- **Text renders in the wrong font:** `inspect` reports `No match for ... font-family`; put the font file in the
  project's `media/` folder and use its exact family name.

## Working on fframes

Agents working on fframes itself should start from [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). For humans, install the
[just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner and init the repo:

```bash
npm install --global pnpm # the package manager for the nodejs based editor
cargo install --locked just cargo-watch wasm-bindgen-cli wasm-pack
just init-repo
just watch-editor # in a separate terminal, to work on the editor
```

## License

fframes is released under the [MIT License](./LICENSE.txt).
