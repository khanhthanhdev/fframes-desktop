# A pushed `v1.2.3` tag is released as `1.2.3`. Every other push to main is a nightly derived
# from the latest tag: after a prerelease tag it continues that prerelease
# (`v1.0.0-beta.7` -> `1.0.0-beta.7.rc-45`), after a stable tag it is a release candidate of
# the next patch version (`v1.0.0` -> `1.0.1-rc.12`), so it sorts after the release and cargo
# and npm keep resolving to the stable one by default. The number is the count of commits
# since the tag.
